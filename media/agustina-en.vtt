00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.640
I'm going to talk about my favorite book

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.000
which is better than the movies by Lynn

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.200
painter so R's book and has a lot of

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.639
Taylor Swift references which I'm a

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.599
total Swifty so it's a reason why I love

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.760
this book it's about two characters

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.800
they're actually neighbors their names

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.920
are Liz and

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.039
Wes um so Liz was trying to win over

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.439
this other guy that she had a crush on

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.560
and this guy was best friends with Wes

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.800
so she know she knew that she needed

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.280
help from Wes in order to be close with

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.440
this other guy and fast forward she ends

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.399
up falling in love with Wes so they're

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.440
actually a couple and it's really cute I

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.879
know that there's I'm really excited

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.360
that in October there's going to be the

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:53.079
second part of this book it's that's

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.039
going to be released um apparently they

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.559
actually broke up and then there's like

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.359
a second chance romance and when they're

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.879
