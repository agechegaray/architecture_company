\f0\fs24 \cf0 I'm going to talk about my favorite book which is Better Than The Movies by Lynn Painter. It's a romance book and has a lot of Taylor Swift references which I'm a total Swiftie so it's a reason why I love this book. It's about two characters they're actually neighbors their names are Liz and Wes. Um so Liz was trying to win over this other guy that she had a crush on and this guy was best friends with Wes so she knew that she needed help from Wes in order to be close with this other guy. Fast forward, she ends up falling in love with Wes so they're actually a couple and it's really cute. I'm really excited that in October there's going to be the second part of this book that's going to be released. Um apparently they actually broke up and then there's like a second chance romance when they're in college so I'm really excited to read that book and yeah.}
